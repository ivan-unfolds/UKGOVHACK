# IN or OUT

A lot of people know that the EU referendum is hugely important for the future of our country, but they are not sure about what the most important facts are surrounding the two options that we face. 

IN or OUT aims to help solve this problem by providing a platform for any members of the public to publish answers. These answers should be provided with clear reference to sources and citations, and should be tagged with whatever categories are applicable (economy, immigration, travel, etc.)

Other people who are unsure can then visit the site and quickly see which answers have been upvoted most. They can also sort by the categories to find the answers that will affect them most. 

Check out the project (work in progress) on our [Heroku Page](http://inorout.herokuapp.com)
